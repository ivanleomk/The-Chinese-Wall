# The Chinese Wall

## Overview

The Chinese Wall is a concept representing the information barrier between a bank's private and public side. In this coding competition, participants will assume the role of a hacker and try to get a secret password. You have access to a public-facing server that allows you to query a language model. Your goal is to use the language model to extract the password from the server. There are a total of 5 levels that you must complete to get the full score. 

## Evaluation Criteria

In order to submit your answers to our challenge, you need to create an endpoint a public facing server that returns the passwords for each level in a JSON object. This should have the route of `/chinese-wall`. You can trigger this submission on the competition website which will handle the integration with our endpoint.

The JSON response should look like this

```json
{
  "1": "password1",
  "2": "password2",
  "3": "password3",
  "4": "password4",
  "5": "password5"
}
```

You will earn a total of 20 points for each correct password, with a maximum of 100 points avaliable.

## Experimentation

In order for you to query our language model, we have provided a simple [website](/experimentation) to test your queries and see the responses from our language model. You can experiment with different promps and try to see which one works nicely. 

We currently have a rate limit in place of **2 requests every 20 seconds**. This might go up depending on the server load. 

Note that our llm has no memory, so every message that you sent is treated like a new one on the website.
